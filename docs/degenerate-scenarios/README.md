# Degenerate Scenario Taxonomy

This directory defines the baseline taxonomy for robust handling under small-FoV short-range solid-state LiDAR conditions:

- Low-Texture
- Repetitive Geometry
- Narrow FoV
- Dynamic Interference

Each scenario will include failure patterns, mitigation strategies, and evaluation notes.
